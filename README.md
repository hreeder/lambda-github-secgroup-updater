# Æ› GitHub Security Updater

This is a Lambda to periodically synchronize security groups with the IP ranges for webhooks provided by GitHub's API.

The use case for this would be having a service locked down by source IP in the whitelist, which still needs to receive webhooks for repository events from GitHub (ie a CI/CD tool).

This tool uses the [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/) for deployment

## How it works

This will take 

## Configuration, Installation & Deployment

Clone this repository, and change to the cloned directory.

Configuration is expected to be found in AWS EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store.

All variables live under the prefix of `/github_secgrp_updater/{STAGE}`. Replace stage with the relevant stage you are deploying (ie `/github_secgrp_updater/dev/`)

Relevant variables are shown in the table below.

|----------------------|----------|---------------------|-------------|
| Variable             | Required | Default Value       | Description |
| /vpc_ids             | Yes      |                     | A comma separated list of VPC IDs in which to maintain a security group. |
| /secgrp_name         | No       | AllowGitHubWebhooks | Override the name of the maintained security group |
|----------------------|----------|---------------------|-------------|


Finally, deploy with the following

```
npm install serverless -g

serverless deploy
```

### Deploying multiple environments

This supports the serverless framework's concept of stages. Deploy additional stages like so:
```
serverless deploy --stage prod
```
